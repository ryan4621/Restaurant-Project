💻 Technologies

⌚️ The Process
--
I designed the UI first, then implemented frontend functionality using JavaScript. The backend was built with PHP to handle form submissions, data validation, and database operations. MySQL was used to store reservation data, with careful handling of user input to ensure security and reliability. Eager to develop my first full stack website to perfect my skills at my initial learning phase, I decided to work with hard-coded values, instead of rendered values and relied heavily on media queries for responsiveness.

📚 What I Learned
--
* Structuring PHP applications for maintainability
* Handling form data and validation securely
* Connecting frontend logic to backend processes
* Managing CRUD operations with MySQL

📈 How It Can Be Improved
--
* Dynamically render menus and reservation details
* Add user authentication and login system
* Add online payment support
* Implement a proper admin dashboard for reservation and email management
* Improve accessibility and mobile responsiveness
* Implement a better email confirmation feature for reservations
